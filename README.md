# Warehouse routing problem solved with q-learning

This repository contains my code for the assignment of the course AE4350 Bio-Inspired Intelligence and Learning for Aerospace Applications. It demonstrates how to solve a warehouse routing problem
(related to the TSP or VRP) using q-learning (a reinforcement learning algorithm). Next to the basic version of the problem, I've also added capacitated and
multi-agent versions. I've also managed to implement it in a parallel way (using multiple cores) with Ray. More information will follow soon.
